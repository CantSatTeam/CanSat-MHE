Each augmentation type (motion blur, lighting, weather, camera quality) has a function `apply_[augmentation type]`. Each of these functions takes in a pillow Image (from the input image folder) and a random seed, and applies the augmentation deterministically with that seed. They return an AugmentOutput, containing the augmented image and a log dictionary, which can then be stored.
